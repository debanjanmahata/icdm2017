This work considers the problem of finding special cycle transversals in perfect graphs and cographs. We prove that finding a minimum cycle transversal T in a perfect graph G is NP-hard, even for bipartite graphs with maximum degree four. Since G - T is acyclic, this result implies that finding a maximum acyclic induced subgraph of a perfect graph is also NP-hard. Other special properties of T are considered. A clique (stable, respectively) cycle transversal, or simply cct (sct, respectively) is a cycle transversal which is a clique (stable set, respectively). Recognizing graphs which admit a cct can be done in polynomial time; however, no structural characterization of such graphs is known, even for perfect graphs. We characterize cographs with cct in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs and describe their structure. This leads to linear time recognition of cographs with cct. We also prove that deciding whether a perfect graph admits an sct is NP-complete. We characterize cographs with sct in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs; this characterization also leads to linear time recognition. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
