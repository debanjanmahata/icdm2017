As several regions of interest may be scattered through the space, an effective search algorithm should balance the exploration of the space to find new potential regions of interest and the exploitation of areas around samples which are known relevant. However, many algorithms concentrate the search on areas which are close to the images that the user has marked as relevant, according to a distance function in the (possibly deformed) multidimensional feature space. This maximizes the number of relevant images retrieved at the first iterations, but limits the discovery of new regions of interest and may leave unexplored a large section of the space. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach that uses a scattered search algorithm based on NSGA II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) only at the first iteration of the relevance feedback process, and then switches to an exploitation algorithm. The combined approach has been tested on three databases and in combination with several other methods. When the hybrid method does not produce better results from the first iteration, it soon catches up and improves both precision and recall. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
