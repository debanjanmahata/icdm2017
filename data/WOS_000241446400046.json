Actually, a type of error can be more important than the other, and a trade-off that minimizes the most important error type must be reached. Despite the importance of type-II errors, most pattern classification methods take into account only the global classification error. In this paper we propose to optimize both error types in classification by means of a multiobjective algorithm in which each error type and the network size is an objective of the fitness function. A modified version of the GProp method (optimization and design of multilayer perceptrons) is used, to simultaneously optimize the network size and the type I and II errors.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective optimization of ensembles of multilayer perceptrons for pattern classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400046"}
